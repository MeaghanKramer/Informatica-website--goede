          </h2>
          <h3 id="introinformationtext"> Form of artificial intelligence (Al) that mainly focuses on learning from experience and making predictions.
Machine Learning is a form of AI and is based on the idea that machines / systems should access data and learn and explore from this data themselves. It is the recognition of patterns from large data sets.

          <h5 id="informationtext"> 
            <ol  >
                  <li>Google uses Machine Learning to identify pictures. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Voice assistants like Siri or Google assistant are being trained by Machine Learning to recognise when someone is talking and what to respond to that. 
                  </li>
                  <li>Spotify uses Machine Learning to make personalized playlists for you by using your preferences and the type of songs you listen which are from other people their playlist(s).

            What is Machine Learning exactly and simple said?
          </h7>

          <h5 id="informationtext">
            Machine learning is a type of artifical intelligence that occurs when computers become more intelligent without humans explicitly teaching them how to behave, it enables a self-learing form data and applies that learing with no need for human intervention. The computer identifies patterns in data and learns from its own mistakes.The 3 main forms of machine learning are: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning.
