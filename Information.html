          <h2 id="informationtext"> (Here we can put loads of text on the subject Machine learning! I even made this page scrollable! The rest of the pages such as about us and contact us and The home page I will be keeping on just one page as we don't really need to put a lot of text in there. I took me a while to figure out how I have to make it scrollable as that was one of the commands I made to make it non-scrollabe. On this particular page I actually can scroll! Enjoy that. At the bottom of this page there will also be a video on the subject of Machine learning but that will appear next weak! According to the PVA I am supposed to make the navigation menu and the different pages with the correct layout. The most work of that is now done, I only need to fix the about and contact but I am hoping that won't take me a lot of work. I've got to tell you, I am kinda proud of what we have accomplished so far. Last friday I spoke to Marit and she said that she hadn't even started writing it, and here we are with this. Meaning we still have a lot of time to fix things like colours, fonts (size and the literal font) and the rounded corners. The main thing for now is the layout, as that is the most complicated part. )

          </h3>
          <h4 id="informationtext"> Form of artificial intelligence (Al) that mainly focuses on learning from experience and making predictions.
Machine Learning is a form of AI and is based on the idea that machines / systems should access data and learn and explore from this data themselves. It is the recognition of patterns from large data sets.

            1. Google uses Machine Learning to identify pictures. 
          </h6>
           <h7 id="informationtext">
              2. Voice assistants like Siri or Google assistant are being trained by Machine Learning to recognise when someone is talking and what to respond to that.
